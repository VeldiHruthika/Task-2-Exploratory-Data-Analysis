Task-2:Exploratory-Data-Analysis(EDA)

About this Task:
Hey! This is my second task where I explored the Titanic dataset and tried to understand the data better using different visualizations and basic statistics.

I used the Titanic dataset again for this task.

What I did in this task:

1.Imported the Titanic dataset using Pandas.

2.Got basic info and summary statistics — like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

3.Plotted histograms for numeric features like Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch to see how the data is spread.

4.Drew boxplots for Age and Fare — to check for outliers.

5.Created a pairplot to see relationships between features — with Survived as hue to notice patterns.

6.Plotted a correlation heatmap to find which features are strongly related.

7.Made an interactive scatter plot (Plotly) for Age vs Fare — colored by Survived — to see how survival depends on these two features.

8.Plotted countplots for Survived and Pclass — to see how many people survived and how many were in each passenger class.

9.Used a violin plot to see the distribution of Age across Pclass and Survival status — helps to understand survival chances based on class and age.

10.Observed and wrote simple inferences based on these plots — like most passengers were in 3rd class, survival chances were higher in 1st class, fare had many outliers, etc.
